-Study of Songbird Visitation at a Feeder near Almsee-

Across the EU, ~600 million songbirds were lost between 1980–2017 (Burns et al., 2021). 
Tits (Paridae)—notably Great, Blue, and Marsh tits—are widespread, easily identified residents and useful ecological indicators (Kajanus et al., 2022). 
This study monitored feeder visitation across time-of-day in a human-inhabited setting at Almsee to identify preferred feeding periods and align feeding with birds’ daily energetic cycles. 
We hypothesized peak visitation at sunrise and sunset, with a midday lull. Using both continuous and scan sampling, continuous sampling showed no significant differences in visit numbers by time-of-day, 
whereas scan sampling indicated significant time-of-day effects (by p-values). 
Given scan sampling’s inherent limitations (snapshot bias, interval dependence), the robustness of those p-values is uncertain, so evidence for strong diel peaks is mixed and method-dependent.
